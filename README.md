# downdoc
> Simple JavaScript markdown documentation generator.

Turns [JS files](/examples/src) into [Markdown docs](/examples/docs)

## Install

```shell
npm i downdoc
```

Install globally with `-g` if you really want but honestly you should just add
it as a `package.json` script. :smile:

## Usage

```shell
downdoc "src/js/**/*.js" docs
```

## API Docs

*Hint:* It's really easy to use downdoc with Gulp if that's your thing.

`downdoc` creates it's own [docs](/docs)
