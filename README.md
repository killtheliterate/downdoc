# downdoc
> Simple JavaScript markdown documentation generator.

## How does it work?

Looks for ES2015 named exports and their leading comments and creates markdown
files that mirror the folder structure of the one supplied.

## Install

```shell
npm i downdoc
```

## Usage

```shell
downdoc src/js docs
```

## Bugs?

Probably. [Tell me about them.](https://github.com/LegitTalon/downdoc/issues/new)

Inspired by PureScript documentation.
